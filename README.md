The article introduces synthetic data generation using Generative AI, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to create artificial datasets that mimic real data's statistical properties. This project walks through preprocessing steps, model architecture, and GAN training for generating synthetic samples. It utilizes a dataset of app usage patterns and focuses on privacy-preserving synthetic data generation.
# Synthetic Data Generation with Generative AI

This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create synthetic data that maintains real-world data patterns, while ensuring privacy. The project demonstrates techniques for preprocessing, training a GAN, and generating synthetic data.

## Features
- GAN model for synthetic data generation
- Data normalization and preprocessing
- Privacy-preserving data practices

## Usage
Prepare and preprocess data
Run synthetic_data_generation.py to train the GAN.
Generate synthetic samples using the trained model.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Numpy
Pandas
TensorFlow
Scikit-learn
